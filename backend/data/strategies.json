Similar to the WBTC-USDC pool, its TVL ($95.6M) is just under the $100M general threshold, but it precisely fits the 'High risk' category definition (APY > 8%, TVL < $100M).

The APY difference of 6.98% significantly surpasses the 1% rebalance threshold, indicating a beneficial move for capital currently earning low returns in a relatively safe, but underutilized, pool.",
