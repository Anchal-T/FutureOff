This offers a substantial yield increase (4.45% difference) but requires asset conversion (USDC to WETH) and involves a higher risk profile (3500 vs 2500) due to impermanent loss and Uniswap-v3's high risk classification based on TVL below $100M for this specific pool. A 50% rebalance is suggested for balanced exposure.",
