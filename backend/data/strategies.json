    "reasoning": "No protocols strictly meet the 'CREATE_STRATEGY' criteria (APY > 4% AND TVL > $100M). The 'NO_ACTION' condition is also not met as high APY options exist. Therefore, a 'REBALANCE' is recommended. Moving capital from a low-yielding, high-TVL asset (Aave-v3 WETH at 1.89% APY, $972M TVL) to a higher-yielding alternative (Uniswap-v3 USDC-WETH at 8.87% APY, $95.6M TVL) provides a significant APY increase of 6.98%, exceeding the 1% rebalance threshold. While Uniswap-v3 carries a higher risk score (3500) and slightly lower TVL than the Aave pool, it offers substantial yield optimization.",
