# Smart Contracts Documentation

This document provides an overview of the smart contracts used in the Yield Optimizer platform.

## Architecture Overview

The smart contract system consists of two main contracts:

### 1. YieldOptimizer.sol
The core contract that handles yield optimization logic.

**Key Features:**
- Strategy execution and management
- Risk assessment
- Position tracking
- Multi-protocol integration

**Main Functions:**
- `optimizeYield()`: Finds and executes optimal yield strategies
- `managePosition()`: Updates and monitors existing positions
- `assessRisk()`: Calculates risk metrics for strategies
- `withdraw()`: Allows users to withdraw funds

### 2. StrategyManager.sol
Manages available yield farming strategies across different protocols.

**Key Features:**
- Strategy registration and validation
- Protocol integration
- Performance tracking
- Strategy scoring

**Main Functions:**
- `addStrategy()`: Registers new yield strategies
- `executeStrategy()`: Executes a specific strategy
- `getStrategyPerformance()`: Returns performance metrics
- `updateStrategyScore()`: Updates strategy effectiveness scores

## Supported Protocols

- **Compound**: Lending and borrowing
- **Aave**: Decentralized lending protocol
- **Uniswap V3**: Liquidity provision
- **Curve**: Stablecoin swaps and yield
- **Balancer**: Multi-token pools

## Security Features

- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Guards against reentrancy attacks
- **Pause Mechanism**: Emergency stop functionality
- **Upgradeable**: Proxy pattern for contract upgrades

## Deployment

Contracts are deployed using Hardhat with the following networks supported:
- Ethereum Mainnet
- Polygon
- Arbitrum
- Optimism

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covers:
- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for cross-contract interactions
- Scenario tests for real-world use cases
- Gas optimization tests

## Gas Optimization

- Batch operations to reduce transaction costs
- Efficient storage patterns
- Minimal external calls
- Optimized loops and calculations

## Upgrade Path

Contracts use OpenZeppelin's upgradeable pattern:
1. Implementation contracts contain the logic
2. Proxy contracts delegate calls to implementations
3. Storage layout is preserved between upgrades
4. Multi-sig governance controls upgrades
